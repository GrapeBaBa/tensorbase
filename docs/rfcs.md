TensorBase RFC(Request for Comments)
-------------------------------------

Now an experimental RFC workflow has been introduced for main committers. It is planned to enable an RFC workflow to trace all the new features and major changes, to make sure all people in community know the progress and leave the document for further people joining. 

We could simplify the format of RFC. Such as:

* Why
* How
* Todo

NOTE: This workflow is just enabled for core committer-level contributions. The target is to let more newcomers know the major features, changes and also the work mechanism of TensorBase. For common contributions, this is not necessary.
