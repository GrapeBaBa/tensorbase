# Summer 2021 of Open Source Promotion Plan

It is excited to announce that TensorBase has joined the ["Summer 2021 of Open Source Promotion Plan"](https://summer.iscas.ac.cn/#/homepage?lang=en).

* Task #1: Adaptive Columnar Storage

  + Outline
  
    Select typical queries, model query costs, and analyze the main time-consuming parts. According to the collected query load, the disk data organization structure is dynamically adjusted to achieve the effect of accelerating system query throughput. 
  
    You need to understand the TensorBase storage, query process, disk data reading principle, and make changes in the key path.
  
  + Skills

    C/Rust, Linux Kernel, Storage

  + Note

    *Rust skill is not must-have*. Welcome any students if you have a good master of programming languages such as C/C++.


* Task #2: Distributed Storage & Query

  + Outline
  
    Based on the Apache Arrow (Rust) and DataFusion, you implement a distributed query for TensorBase. In the meantime, we may create a distributed storage mechanism for TensorBase .
    
    You need to understand the TensorBase storage, query process, disk data reading principle, and make changes in the key path.
  
  + Skills

    C/Rust, Linux Kernel, distributed, network

  + Note

    *Rust skill is not must-have*. Welcome any students if you have a good master of programming languages such as C/C++.


* Task #3: Top Performance MySQL Protocol Server in Rust

  + Outline
  
    You add a top performance MySQL protocol server into TensorBase to make TensorBase to talk with MySQL client.
    
    You need to understand current top performance TensorBase ClickHouse compatible server and network side things, the frontend of query process, and contribute to the key path.
  
  + Skills

    C/Rust, Linux, web, server, tcp, network

  + Note

    *Rust skill is not must-have*. Welcome any students if you have a good master of programming languages such as C/C++.

* Task #4: Systematic Enhancement to Apache Arrow and DataFusion

  + Outline
  
    There are different designs between Apache Arrow/DataFusion and TensorBase. These make Apache Arrow/DataFusion lacking some important stuffs which is good or needed for a data warehouse.
    
    You need to understand current Apache Arrow and DataFusion's code, working mechanism of TensorBase, and contribute to the key path of Arrow and DataFusion.
  
  + Skills

    C/Rust, Linux, Query engine

  + Note

    *Rust skill is not must-have*. Welcome any students if you have a good master of programming languages such as C/C++.
    
* Task #5: Top Performance ClickHouse HTTP Protocol Server in Rust

  + Outline
  
    You add a top performance ClickHouse HTTP server into TensorBase to make TensorBase to talk with ClickHouse HTTP client.
    
    You need to understand current top performance TensorBase ClickHouse compatible server and network side things, the frontend of query process, and contribute to the key path.
